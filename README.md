# Smoothor

Welcome to Smoothor!

Smoothor is a great app that helps people collect data about the conditions of a road network concerning potholes and the general smoothness of it. This is done using smartphones' gyroscope, GPS and the API of Mapbox. The application by now collects and shows data locally, but it can display multiple results from many users as long as the JSON files are saved in a shared server. Any programmer may feel free to advance it. 

PS: This add-on would be great for Google Maps!
